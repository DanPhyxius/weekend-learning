# Contribution Guidelines

**Whatever you want to suggest, just be sure that many people can done it in a weekend. If you're not totally sure about it, try to find something more suitable, maybe a specific "route", like a "Getting Started" tutorial, or similar.**

All you have to know is that the list is divided into *Categories*. Every category has one or more activities inside of it. If it can be useful, a category can contain more subcategories.

```markdown
#### Category Name
- **_Activity_**: *activity description*
- **_Activity2_**: *activity2 description*

#### Category2 Name
- **Subcategory Name**
  - **_Activity_**: *activity description*
  - **_Activity2_**: *activity2 description*
```

So:

- the **Category Name** will be an header (H4);
- the **Subcategory Name**, if present, will be bold;
- the **_Activity_** name will be both bold and italic;
- the *activity description* will be italic;
- there will be a whiteline between two categories;

Also, if you're creating a new category, **don't forget to add it to index!**

All you will have to do is to make a pull request for new item/items. If the category for your item does not exist, feel free to suggest a new one. The same goes for subcategories. **Just be compliant with the given rules.**

Thank you! :)
