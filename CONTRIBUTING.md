# Contribution Guidelines

**Whatever you want to suggest, just be sure that many people can done it in a weekend. If you're not totally sure about it, try to find something more suitable, maybe a specific "route", like a "Getting Started" tutorial, or similar.**

All you have to know is that the list is divided into *Categories*. Every category has one or more activities inside of it. If it can be useful, a category can contain more subcategories.

```markdown
- **Category Name**
  - Activity: *activity description*
  - Activity2: *activity2 description*

- **Category2 Name**
  - **_Subcategory Name_**
    - Activity: *activity description*
    - Activity2: *activity2 description*
```

So:

- the **Category Name** will be bold;
- the Activity name will be regular;
- the *activity description* will be italic;
- the _**Subcategory Name**_ will be both bold and italic;
- there will be a whiteline between two categories;

All you will have to do is to make a pull request for new item/items. If the category for your item does not exist, feel free to suggest a new one. The same goes for subcategories. **Just be compliant with the given rules.**

Thank you! :)
